              <p> 12 Hours and about 1,000 miles later I arrived at the Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado intersection. Luckily there was campground right off I-80. I set up camp around 2 A.M. and it was 20 degrees with 40 MPH wind gusts. Unfortunate that the car was packed to the brim, so I couldn't find gloves + hat. So it goes. The tent exceeded my expectations! Was simple to set up in the pitch dark and was insulated nicely. </p>

              <p> Made it to the future hometown! Came to drop items off in a storage locker and register the car. Another long day of driving and finished up cleaning the car out around 9 P.M. Too dark to find a nice off-road spot to set up camp unforuntately. So, settled on an RV park in downtown Salt Lake. This morning I registered the car, so now that it is clean and the errands are done I can make way up to Seattle to actually start the trip for what it is supposed to be. Will be searching for more peaceful, beautiful spots. <br><br>Arriving here was quite scary. I spent a few months with clear thinking and came to the conclusion this was a good decision. So why was it scary if I thought I planned? <br><br>
              Seeing the city made me question if it was actually possible to start a business and grow. I saw the city and then thought it was too daunting to expand it to such a large population. The feeling of doubt crept in and sparked even deeper questions. What am I doing? What do I want to be doing? But being forced to ask (and trying to answer) is the entire point of me putting myself in this environment, isn't it?<br><br>
              Luckily with a clearer head on my drive to Seattle I realized there was a flaw in my initial reaction. During the planning stage prior to the move I did not expect to build and magically distribute to an entire city. I fully acknowelged that for the idea to work I'd start in my neighborhood (a tractable problem), and if it succeeds grow from there. The "start local" rationale was the deciding factor into my apartment choice. </p>
