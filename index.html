              <p> 12 Hours and about 1,000 miles later I arrived at the Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado intersection. Luckily there was campground right off I-80. I set up camp around 2 A.M. and it was 20 degrees with 40 MPH wind gusts. Unfortunate that the car was packed to the brim, so I couldn't find gloves + hat. So it goes. The tent exceeded my expectations! Was simple to set up in the pitch dark and was insulated nicely. </p>

              <p> Made it to the future hometown! Came to drop items off in a storage locker and register the car. Another long day of driving and finished up cleaning the car out around 9 P.M. Too dark to find a nice off-road spot to set up camp unforuntately. So, settled on an RV park in downtown Salt Lake. This morning I registered the car, so now that it is clean and the errands are done I can make way up to Seattle to actually start the trip for what it is supposed to be. Will be searching for more peaceful, beautiful spots. <br><br>Arriving here was quite scary. The idea of getting out of comfort zone and moving west made a lot of sense â€“ but having the idea come to fruitition made me re-question some essential questions. What am I doing? What do I want to be doing? But being forced to ask (and trying to answer) is the entire point of me putting myself in this environment, isn't it?</p>
