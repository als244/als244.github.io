  <p> Hi, I'm Andrew Sheinberg. I'm currently living in Salt Lake City, UT reading papers and exploring nature. Prior to Utah, I lived in Chicago for a around a year where I worked as an options trader on the Index Strategy desk. Before that, I attended Yale University where I studied Computer Science & Mathematics. Next, I will be applying to graduate school for a Computer Science PhD where I'm hoping to research low-level optimizations for high-throughput problems. I plan to concentrate on problems involving parallel and concurrent computing. I'm hoping my research will span across various layers of system stack: architecture, operating systems, & distributed systems. Ideally, I'd like to explore systems reserach by diving into an application area. The domains I'm most interesting in are computer vision, robotics, graph processing, and physics simulations. It is important to me to combine theoretical ideas for algorithmic improvements with proper, practical implementation. </p>


  <p> For leisure, I enjoy skiing and surfing. I also like taking pictures and have linked some of my favorite photos and memorable travel adventures. </p>
