  <p> Hi, I'm Andrew Sheinberg. I'm currently living in Salt Lake City, UT. Prior to Utah, I lived in Chicago for around 8 months where I worked as an options trader on the Index Strategy desk. Before that, I attended Yale University where I studied Computer Science & Mathematics. My speciality is low latency, high throughput applications. Next, I will be applying to graduate school for a Computer Science PhD where I'm hoping to research Parallel Computing architecures and algorithms. </p>


  <p> For leisure, I enjoy skiing (and thus my Utah decision) surfing. I also like to take pictures and have linked some of my memorable travel adventures and favorite photos. </p>
