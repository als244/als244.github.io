    <p> Hi, I'm Andrew Sheinberg. I'm currently living in Salt Lake City, UT reading papers and exploring nature. Prior to Utah, I lived in Chicago for a around a year where I worked as an options trader on the Index Strategy desk. Before that, I attended Yale University where I studied Computer Science & Mathematics. Next, I will be applying to graduate school for a Computer Science PhD where I'm hoping to research low-level optimizations for high-throughput problems. </p>

    <p> For leisure, I enjoy skiing, surfing, and playing games. I also like taking pictures and have linked some of my favorite photos and memorable travel adventures. </p>

    <p> I plan to concentrate on problems involving parallel and concurrent computing. I'm hoping my research will span across various layers of the system stack: architecture, operating systems, distributed systems, & programming interfaces. I'd like to explore systems research by diving into an application area. The domains I'm most interesting in are computer vision + robotics, graph processing, and physics simulations. It is important to me to combine theoretical ideas for algorithmic improvements with practical implementation. </p>

    <p> Memory is today's biggest issue: the general purpose von Neumann architectures were not designed to handle massive datasets and parallel computation. As a partial remedy, we employ a diverse memory hierarchy to exploit spatial and temporal locality. Programming algorithms to utilize the hardware caches most effectively is typically a difficult task. We are starting to see specialized architectures (GPUs, FPGAs, domain-specific ASICs) to handle modern datasets and algorithms, but we will still face the need for locality optimizations. Now, assume we are in a distributed setting... the already non-trivial problem of maximing locality for an individual node gets even harder. Improving data movement through better algorithms, which are co-designed with modern hardware, will yield gains in energy efficiency and run-time performance. Efficient computing is economically important now, but it will also inspire the intelligent algorithms and devices of the future. </p>
