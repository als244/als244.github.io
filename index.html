              After some hiking in Malibu, John and I went to Santa Monica to hangout at the beach and found a park to see the sunset. We are going to dinner with Rachel tonight and then dropping John off at airport at 3 A.M. 
              <br><br>
              Not sure what the next week is looking like, but will probably stay a few nights with Rachel. The nomadic car-camping lifestyle of traveling and having no agenda has been nice, but is getting a bit old and making me feel a bit anxious...

              We drove down the coast after Big Sur and stopped in Santa Barabara. We drove up 3000 ft on the hills behind the city (where there were some insane houses) and found this spot off the the side of the road. These were views we woke up to.

              After driving back from Yosemite on the night of the 13th I stayed on a trail near Santa Cruz. In the morning I went surfing at a famous spot called "The Hook" where the waves were pretty big (for me at least). I did catch a baby wave, but there were serious surfers here doing the real stuff. I mostly came to observe.

              Truly phenomenal couple days. Hard to not be humbled by this park. Everything about this place was great. Clean air, nice areas to set up camp, great hikes, tremendous views. Felt isolated, but also weirdly at home.

              The plan was to go to Big Sur for a few nights then Yosemite. However, the weather wasn't looking so great and John is coming earlier than planned before. I woke up in Monterey, but then started driving to Yosemite.

              Had an awesome weekend in SF. We went out on Friday night, had delicious Dim Sum for recovery on Saturday morning with Charles and Rishay. Then we went to see Pacific Heights and chilled in hot tub. Walked around The Marina and took in beautiful weather. Went over to Finn's house to watch the UFC card with Charles, Finn, and Will. Then we met up with Mickey and he brought us to Brazenhead (local divey bar) late night when it was empty and we were having some real conversations. This was the best part of the weekend. Sturdy. Sunday was casually hanging out after a diner. Great guys and looking forward visiting them all again. <br><br> Tonight (Sunday night) I'm leaving to go to Big Sur for a couple days then Yosemite for a couple days. Will be back in SF next weekend to see Max and John before heading down to LA.

              After sunset in Coos Bay I drove to a campground in Redwoods National Forest (outside of Crescent City, California). The trees were big, but honestly didn't feel too special. Didn't spend much time here and immediately woke up and started driving to the Bay Area. Passed by some beautiful overlooks in NorCal. 
              <br><br>
              After 7 hours of driving I made it to Bolinas Beach (an hour north of SF) and hopped in the water. The ocean here was vastly different than what I saw in Oregon. Calm water, with predictable waves. Felt like the same Ocean as in Costa Rica and I was able to catch a wave fully. Great feeling and gave a confidence boost and sign of potential. 
              <br><br>
              Looking forward to going out in SF with Charles and his friends. Will be taking a couple nights away from the tent and on a couch instead.

              Had a really peacful wakeup in the mountains in Southern Oregon. Cooking breakfast using the energy from the sun hits different! Loving the battery and other toys.  <br><br> After some breakfast and reading (Ben Franklin biography) I drove to Coos Bay, Oregon. The break here was a bit easier, but still not beginner friendly. I met some awesome people on the beach (marine biologist, carpenter, farmer) who were all surfers and were very helpful with giving me tips to understand what to try and read in the Ocean. The beach was nice and quaint and has probably been my favorite stop in the trip so far. 
              <br><br>
              Going to drive to the redwoods in Northern California tonight and planning on driving to San Fransciso tomorrow night (April 8th) to hang out with Charles & Co. for the weekend.

              I really want to learn how to surf. It seems like it shares a bunch of similarities with skiing (competitor is Mother Nature & it rewards aggression). When I tried to first surf the week in Costa Rica I loved being in the water and caught a couple baby waves, which gave me hope that I could take it a bit more seriously.
              <br><br>
              So I picked up a wetsuit and board and tried surfing in Otter Rock, Oregon. The waves were 5-8 feet with strong force and a powerful current. Not a break for beginners. So I kept it simple for the first day and was just practicing my paddling close to the shore. Still a really good workout, but seeing the other surfers attacking those big waves made it clear I have a lot of learning to do. <br><br> Going to continue driving south because there are a lot of things I'm planning for California and the waves will be more beginner friendly.

Then I left to start the trip down the coast! <br><br> My first night was in Lincoln City, Oregon and this was my first true "off-road" experience.

              <p> After the rainforest, we drove to the northwest corner of the state and settled at a campground around 6 P.M. It was a long day of seeing stuff and we were pretty kicked, so just chilled out for most of the night. <br><br>
              The night was crazy rainy and windy. The tent shielded us but we got soaked packing up the car. As cool as the cascading geography is, I'm really not of fan of the constant rain. Beautiful geography for rain is not a trade I'm willing to make. 
              <br><br>
              We made it to Cape Flattery in the morning. This is the home of the Makah Tribe. Clayton and I imagined the lives of Native Americans and found the views to be pretty mesmerizing. This is the most Northwest Corner of the lower 48.

Solar panels not too effective up here in the Pacific Northwest... <br><br>
              The day started with a walk along the beach. We saw the geography for all its glory. The waves crashed hard, giant rocks, big ole' trees. Pretty impressive stuff. <br><br>
              Later on in the day we went to Olympic National Park and saw the Hoh Rainforest. The trees here were gorgeous.

              <p> Made it to the future hometown! Came to drop items off in a storage locker and register the car. Another long day of driving and finished up cleaning the car out around 9 P.M. Too dark to find a nice off-road spot to set up camp unforuntately. So, settled on an RV park in downtown Salt Lake. This morning I registered the car, so now that it is clean and the errands are done I can make way up to Seattle to actually start the trip for what it is supposed to be. Will be searching for more peaceful, beautiful spots. <br><br>Arriving here was quite scary. Though, I did spend a few months with clear thinking and came to the conclusion this was a good decision.It might be scary, but I have to have confidence that it will be good for me. Remembering this optimistic, forward-looking perspective is comforting and helps combat the fear. Exciting next chapter ahead!

              <p> 12 Hours and about 1,000 miles later I arrived at the Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado intersection. Luckily there was campground right off I-80. I set up camp around 2 A.M. and it was 20 degrees with 40 MPH wind gusts. Unfortunate that the car was packed to the brim, so I couldn't find gloves + hat. So it goes. The tent exceeded my expectations! Was simple to set up in the pitch dark and was insulated nicely. </p>
