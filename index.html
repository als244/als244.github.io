              <p> After the rainforest, we drove to the northwest corner of the state and settled at a campground around 6 P.M. It was a long day of seeing stuff and we were pretty kicked, so just chilled out for most of the night. <br><br>
              The night was crazy rainy and windy. The tent shielded us but we got soaked packing up the car. <br><br>
              <br><br>
              We made it to Cape Flattery in the morning. This is the home of the Makah Tribe. Clayton and I imagined the lives of Native Americans and found the views to be pretty mesmerizing. This is the most Northwest Corner of the lower 48. 
              <br><br>
              We are taking the Ferry back to Seattle, getting cleaned up and grabbing dinner. I'm going to take Clayton to work tomorrow and will see the Microsoft campus.

              <p> After the ferry we drove to the coast and found the Mora campground and set up tent there. We were able to cook breakfast with the induction burner and make coffee using the electric kettle but the battery was running out of juice. Solar panels not too effective up here in the Pacific Northwest... <br><br>
              The day started with a walk along the beach. We saw the geography for all its glory. The waves crashed hard, giant rocks, big ole' trees. Pretty impressive stuff. <br><br>
              Later on in the day we went to Olympic National Park and saw the Hoh Rainforest. The trees here were gorgeous.

              <p> I drove 8 hours, then slept at a rest stop for 3 hours, then hopped back on the road to get to Seattle by 8 A.M. Clayton welcomed me with a shower and a bed to rest in before a job interview at noon. I got the job offer but after speaking with the management team and hearing about my role it cemented my opinion that entry-level roles in the trading industry were definitely not for me. <br><br>
              Clayton and I are planning on going to the Olympic Peninsula to see the ocean, mountains, and rainforest. Should be an exciting venture. The ferry ride we took had a gorgeous backdrop of the city.

              <p> Made it to the future hometown! Came to drop items off in a storage locker and register the car. Another long day of driving and finished up cleaning the car out around 9 P.M. Too dark to find a nice off-road spot to set up camp unforuntately. So, settled on an RV park in downtown Salt Lake. This morning I registered the car, so now that it is clean and the errands are done I can make way up to Seattle to actually start the trip for what it is supposed to be. Will be searching for more peaceful, beautiful spots. <br><br>Arriving here was quite scary. I spent a few months with clear thinking and came to the conclusion this was a good decision. So why was it scary if I thought I planned? <br><br>
              Seeing the city made me question if it was actually possible to start a business and grow. I saw the city and then thought it was too daunting to expand it to such a large population. The feeling of doubt crept in and sparked even deeper questions. What am I doing? What do I want to be doing? But being forced to ask (and trying to answer) is the entire point of me putting myself in this environment, isn't it?<br><br>
              Luckily with a clearer head on my drive to Seattle I realized there was a flaw in my initial reaction. During the planning stage prior to the move I did not expect to build and magically distribute to an entire city. I fully acknowelged that for the idea to work I'd start in my neighborhood (a tractable problem), and if it succeeds grow from there. The "start local" rationale was the deciding factor into my apartment choice. </p>

              <p> 12 Hours and about 1,000 miles later I arrived at the Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado intersection. Luckily there was campground right off I-80. I set up camp around 2 A.M. and it was 20 degrees with 40 MPH wind gusts. Unfortunate that the car was packed to the brim, so I couldn't find gloves + hat. So it goes. The tent exceeded my expectations! Was simple to set up in the pitch dark and was insulated nicely. </p>
