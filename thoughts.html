              <h2> Not all money is equal! </h2>

              <p>I think in basic economic theory the utility funciton of gaining $1 is only dependent on the existing wealth of the individual. However, I'd argue that it is also strongly dependent on the mechanism of gaining it. <br><br>
              Assume I could receive $1 from selling a product people enjoyed vs. receive $1 from taking it away from someone else. Which would I rather do? Of course, I'd rather sell a product people liked. How can we formalize this? <br><br>

              My utility is conditional on my own "morals". More formally: The utility function of the <b>other</b> party in the transaction is an input to <b>my</b> function. In one scenario it is a fair "trade" (both parties benefit) vs. the other (one party benefits, while the other loses). My morals (the extent to which the other parties' utility function contributes to my own utility) cause me to choose the fair "trade" activity to generate that same $1. <br><br>

              After my stint as a quant and obsessing about markets, I view many aspects of life through the lense of "trade". Every "action" can be broken down into a "trade". Choose the trades you like!</p>

              <h2> Why did I quit my job so soon? </h2>

              <p> I'm sure many people are wonding if I'm "crazy" to quit a job I worked to long to get. Well the overly-simplisitic version is that my priors updated after I noticed unexpected changes in my marginal utility function (read <em>Not all money is equal!</em>) and after I saw the work environment. Also because I started to form a plan for a career replacement possibility.
              <br><br> Let's break those reasons down further...
              
              <ul>

              <li> <h3>Utility Changes</h3>

              I've always wanted to make money. I think the underlying cause of this is a desire for freedom. Independence of forging my own path is a core trait and I knew that money was a limiting factor for this. However, I over-estimated the amount of $ required to surpass this bar (at least for the short term...). Moreover, my "morals" changed as I grew and started to form a better understanding of the world. I saw where the money from my paycheck was coming from and felt a bit icky. A large percentage of the people we were trading against didn't understand how options work and are valued â€“ and we knew that they didn't understand. As an option market maker (options dealer), our main role was to buy and sell from "customers" (non-market-makers). Each of these transactions is a trade. I'm morally OK with the service being provided to people who have legitmate reasons and an understanding of how options are valued. However, a large percentage of customers do not understand how options work or are valued. Normally in business the customer knows the product they get, but in the case of trading options against retail flow / basic institutional clients the customer doesn't really know the product they get. Many people think they do, likely because of a string a luck from a latent variable. I morally felt icky with the fact that we knew we were trading against people who didn't understand the reason they were trading. </br>

             </li>
             <br>
             <li> <h3>Workplace Environment</h3> 

             Put simply: I saw bureaucracy in action and hated it. I view employees as helping to contribute to the bottom line in whatever way they can. Many instances the assignments I was given were busy work to send to my manager for my manger to send to his manager to prove that employees were "working". The heirarchy contributed to incentivizing useless (not improving bottom line) tasks. It fogged the goals of the business and funneled the decision making to leaders at the top. If the people at towards the top of this heirarchal structure don't know what they are doing, then the whole thing crumbles. <br><br>

             I saw the busy-work and stood up to it. I wanted to know why they were wasting my time. The reason "because I said so". Opposition to authority figures who rule on the basis of blind trust is another core trait of mine. I enjoy and get behind authority figures who can justify their decisions. 

             <br><br> A quote from my manager that is symbolic and exposes the core attitude I disagree with. The quote comes after I was working on a modelling problem (normally reserved to the PhDs, but is a problem that has a strong impact on the bottom line)...<br><br>

             <em>"I'M your manager, SO I DEFINE what your role here is" </em>(said with smirking face and shaking confidence) - January 14th, 2022.

             <br><br>

             I get that this is the typical way a business operates, but it is one I strongly oppose. What happens when managers optimize for things that don't improve the bottom of the line business? This property is an initial conditon for an emergent bureaucracy. 

             I just wanted to improve a model so the company could make more money. However, due to the bureaucracy and incentive structure, me working on this problem was actually bad for my manager. It made him see less useful. His main objective was to keep underlings "in line", not to make the business better.
